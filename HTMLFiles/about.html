                    <p>I studied my GCSEs at Portadown College and acheived 10 ranging from grades A*-C* including English and Maths.</p>
                    <p>Portadown College is where I first found my love for computing, at the college I studied Digital Technology Programming, in this subject I got my first taste of programming, learning Python so that I could make a pupil management system for a school who were going on a ski trip, this was a part of my course work.</p>

                    <p>From Portadown College I moved on to the Southern Regional College where I am currently studing towards a Level 3 Extended Diploma in Information Technology</p>
                    <p>I decided to study a BTEC at the Southern Regional College instead of staying on and pursuing A-levels at the Portadown college as the topics that the Southern Regional College offered are more benefical to me as I knew I wanted to pursue a carrer in the technology industry.</p>

                <p>The first langauge that I learnt was Python, I found Python in the first year of my GCSEs and since then I have continued to learn the language. I used Python most recently for my IoT assignment where I used a Raspberry Pi with a Sense Hat to record go kart telemetery data, I then transmitted this data from the Raspberry Pi to another computer using sockets.</p>

                <p>This year I decided to test myself by learning a new language, and I chose C#. I believe that the best way to learn something is by doing it, because of this I decided to experiment with C# to create a curreny exchanger desktop application that uses real time curreny data gathered from an api. After using C# for this project I wanted to test other languages before I chose the one that I started to properly learn.</p>

                <p>After C# I decided to investigate what Java was like, so I attempted all of the Java tutorials on the W3 Schools website. I finished the tutorials and I believe that it is a contender to be the lanuguage that I decide to focus on. I would like to use Java similarily to the way I did C# and use the language to create a project.</p>

                <p>This year I attended a three day work experience programme at Kainos, a part of this experience was creating a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this is were I first used these technologies. The next time I used these technologies was in school for my website development assignment were I created a website for a web development company named Hot Beans which will be on my Github once the year is over. I quite enjoy using these technologies, specifically JavaScript as I like it's syntax, it is a contender for the language that I will learn next.</p>
